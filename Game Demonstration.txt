Welcome to the "Amateur Bank Robber" Adventure Game!

You burst into a small bank lobby. There are a few people around the room—a quiet day at the bank, as planned.
 “Uh... Attention! This is a bank robbery! Everybody just, uh, remain calm! I just want my money and then I'm out of here.” 
You read mixed emotions around the room of fear, confusion, and … bemusement?
Well, go on! Go and rob that bank so you can tell all of your friends about it!

Your goal is to successfully rob Main Street Bank and take away as much money as you can without getting caught.
You have 100 moves to get the bag of money from the Vault and bring it to the Trap Door!
